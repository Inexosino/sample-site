    <strong>PORTUGAL. THE MAN</strong> is an American rock band from Wasilla, Alaska, currently residing in Portland, Oregon. The group consists of lead singer <b>John Baldwin Gourley</b>, Gourley's partner and backup singer <b>Zoe Manville</b>, bassist <b>Zach Carothers</b>, keyboardist <b>Kyle O'Quin</b>, drummer <b>Jason Sechrist</b>, and guitarist <b>Eric Howk</b>. Gourley and Carothers met and began playing music together in 2001 at Wasilla High School.<br />
    <br />
    The band was originally started as John Gourley's side project, with Carothers playing bass. Before they had a drummer, they used drum machines and synth-loops as the backing beat. Gourley and Carothers teamed up with Wesley Hubbard, Nick Klein (former guitar tech for <p class="small-caps">anatomy of a ghost</p>) and Harvey Tumbleson, and formed <p class="small-caps">Portugal. The Man</p>. The band left Alaska and went to Portland with the intent of recording and touring. The band recorded demos in the summer of 2004, followed by a U.S. tour that fall. In spring 2005, Klein and Tumbleson left and soon after Jason Christie joined the band. <p class="small-caps">Portugal. The Man</p>'s debut record <p class="yellow">Waiter: "You Vultures!"</p> was released by Fearless Records on January 24, 2006. The album was produced by Casey Bates. The band's name is based on the idea of David Bowie's "bigger than life" fame. They wanted the band to have a bigger-than-life feel but did not want to name it after one of their members. "A country is a group of people," John Gourley explains. "With Portugal, it just ended up being the first country that came to mind. The band's name is 'Portugal'. The period is stating that, and 'The Man' states that it's just one person." The name has more personal meaning, as well: "Portugal. The Man" was going to be the name of a book that Gourley had planned to write about his father and his many adventures.<br />
    <br />
    On June 22, 2007, they released their second full-length album, <p class="yellow">Church Mouth</p>, again produced by Casey Bates, and set out on a full U.S. headline tour with support from <p class="small-caps">the photo atlas</p>, <p class="small-caps">play radio play</p>, <p class="small-caps">tera melos</p> and <p class="small-caps">the only children</p>, among others. They then toured Europe and followed it with another U.S. headlining tour, with support from <p class="small-caps">rocky votolato</p> and <p class="small-caps">great depression</p> during September and October. Following this tour, they joined Thursday on a short east coast tour in November alongside <p class="small-caps">circle takes the square</p>.<br />
    <br />
    In 2008, the band left their label, Fearless Records, and added Ryan Neighbors, their touring keyboardist, as an official member and replacement for Wes Hubbard. On July 30, 2008, it was announced that <p class="small-caps">Portugal. The Man</p> was releasing <p class="yellow">Censored Colors</p> under its independent record label, Approaching AIRballoons, in partnership with Equal Vision Records. It was released September 16. Zoe Manville, a musician and graphic designer, was involved with this album and has an active involvement on all albums since 2008. John Gourley was also chosen as the recipient of the 2008 <i>AP Magazine</i>'s "Best Vocalist of the Year." On April 9, the band announced the next album, <p class="yellow">The Satanic Satanist</p>, which was released on July 21, 2009. <i>The Satanic Satanist</i> is themed around memories and stories from singer John Gourley's youth in Alaska. The album was recorded with the help of record producer Paul Kolderie of <p class="small-caps">pixies</p> and <p class="small-caps">radiohead</p> fame. Then, on February 11, 2010, Gourley announced that <p class="yellow">American Ghetto</p>, the band's fifth studio album, would be released March 2.<br />

    In April 2010, <p class="small-caps">Portugal. The Man</p> announced their signing to Atlantic Records. During the summer of 2010, the band went back into the studio to record their new album with producer John Hill. They recorded the album in El Paso, Texas; London, England; and San Diego, California. Andy Wallace mixed the album. During their fall tour in 2010, <p class="small-caps">Portugal. The Man</p> played a new song known as "We Got It All". At SXSW 2011, they debuted another song titled "Senseless". Starting on April 7, 2011, <p class="small-caps">Portugal. The Man</p> began releasing one thirty-second clip every week from their new album via their YouTube channel. The songs were "Once Was One", "All Your Light (Times Like These)", and "So American". On April 29, 2011, the first full track was released entitled "Got It All (This Can't Be Living Now)". They released their second song on May 5 entitled "Sleep Forever". The full album, <p class="yellow">In the Mountain In the Cloud</p>, was released on July 19, 2011. <p class="small-caps">Portugal. The Man</p>'s short film, "Sleep Forever", directed by Michael Ragen, clocks in at over thirteen minutes and was shot entirely in Gourley's hometown of Willow, Alaska. "Sleep Forever" premiered via IFC on June 6, 2011.<br />
    <br />
    On April 3, 2012, it was announced via Facebook that keyboardist Ryan Neighbors would be leaving the band to pursue his own music career with his new project, <p class="small-caps">hustle and drone</p>. He was replaced by Kyle O'Quin. Drummer Jason Sechrist was replaced by former child actor and drummer Kane Ritchotte shortly after Neighbors' departure. The following year, on February 8, 2013, <p class="small-caps">Portugal. The Man</p> leaked pictures on Bonnaroo's official Tumblr page which showed that celebrated producer Brian Burton, otherwise known as Danger Mouse, was producing the band's new record. According to a Q&A session Zach did on <p class="small-caps">Portugal. The Man</p>'s official Tumblr page, their new album was influenced by <p class="small-caps">pink floyd</p> and <i>The Dark Side of the Moon</i>.<br />
    <br />
    On February 25, 2013, <p class="small-caps">Portugal. The Man</p> released the name of their new album, titled <p class="yellow">Evil Friends</p>, on Instagram. On March 6, the band revealed the album art using a Tweet-to-reveal mosaic. The next day, the video for the title track from <i>Evil Friends</i> was released on the band's YouTube channel. Finally, on June 4, 2013, the album was released in the United States. The album featured backing vocals by Este Haim and Danielle Haim. A music video of "Purple Yellow Red and Blue" followed.<br />
    <br />
    On April 22, 2014, the band announced a partnership with Smithsonian's National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute to release a limited-edition run of four hundred records, in order to raise awareness for critically-endangered Sumatran tigers. The track, "Sumatran Tiger", does not officially exist digitally, and the copies were sent to "400 carefully chosen influencers, among them actors, activists, musicians, conservationists, bloggers and journalists," and is, as the band claims, "the first song meant to go extinct unless it's reproduced." The band encouraged fans to "scour the Internet" using the hashtags #EndangeredSong and #SumatranTiger to find recordings of the song.<br />
    <br />
    In November 2014, <p class="small-caps">Portugal. The Man</p> were in the studio recording their eighth album with Mike D from <p class="small-caps">the beastie boys</p> producing. The band also actively updated their Instagram account with photos of Mike D and the band together in their studio, as well as showcasing small teasers of what their new album would sound like. Mac Miller was also shown working with the band as well. The first week of May, 2015, the band released teasers on social networks of what appeared to be new music with a Latin twist, including huapango guitars, dream synths, and drum machines. On May 5, <p class="small-caps">Portugal. The Man</p> released a Spanish version of "Purple Yellow Red and Blue", covered by Mexican-American band <p class="small-caps">the chamanas</p>, on their official YouTube channel to celebrate Cinco de Mayo. Then, on December 31, 2015, <p class="small-caps">Portugal. The Man</p> posted to their website that they had completed two records followed by separate hashtags #Gloomin + #Doomin. However, on February 3, 2016, the band tweeted from their official account that the new single record would be entitled <i>Gloomin + Doomin</i>. In February 2016 <p class="small-caps">Portugal. The Man</p> were featured on the Yoko Ono collaboration album <i>Yes, I'm A Witch Too</i>, performing "Soul Got Out of the Box".<br />
    <br />
    On November 30, 2016, Triple J radio debuted <p class="small-caps">Portugal. The Man</p>'s new song "Noise Pollution". It was released as a single, "Noise Pollution [Version A, Vocal Up Mix 1.3]", on December 2, and featured Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Zoe Manville. On March 3, 2017, the band released a single titled "Feel It Still", which was followed by the release of an accompanying music video three days later. It was revealed that <i>Gloomin + Doomin</i> "failed to complete" and was thrown out after three years. They have since completed another album, titled <p class="yellow">Woodstock</p>, which is promoted by "Feel It Still". The album's title was inspired by an original 1969 Woodstock music festival ticket stub owned by Gourley's father. It led Gourley to a realization that almost fifty years later, music has the same mission as then: "to comment on societal and political unease." "We worked with so many rad people on this album, but ended up with just the four of us in a basement at 4 a.m. trying to say something that mattered," said Gourley. "Trying to write music that would help people feel they're not alone, even if they're angry or feeling lost." Now their latest album, <i>Woodstock</i>, is available for listening and purchase.
