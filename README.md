HTML5/CSS course prototype.
<!DOCTYPE cleartext>
Welcome, visitor. This is a repository of files for a website project associated with a postgraduate HTML5/CSS course. I do not claim to be a code wizard; certainly, this is my first time working in HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. As such, you're welcome to comment on the cleanliness of my code, and make suggestions on how I can improve the website's functionality and design. If, for whatever reason, you'd like to iterate upon what I have here, my only request is that you attribute the original design to me (Sino). Thanks!
